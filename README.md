# Pands Problem Sheet

## Introduction

This readme file is a decriptor of weekly tasks assigned to us in order to practice learning in the Module - Programming and Scripting. The Programming and scripting module form part of the higher diploma in Data Analytics from the Atlantic Technological University - ATU.

In this readme file I will explain the aim of the weekly tasks that were assigned. I will explain how I came to write the programs I uploaded. I will also explain my thought processes behind the programmes and I will identify what websites or resources gave me inspiration.

# Week 1 - Hello World Task
=======
There was a number of tasks in Week1. I introduced myself in the discussion forum. I created my environment by following the instuctions in the lectures. I have always had an interest in computing but more from a gaming and communication aspect. I found setting up the environment a challange due to my lack of knowlege about computing vocabulary. I installed the software as instructed - visual basic, commander, python and set up an account on Github.
I than wrote by first programme. This was a very basic programme and was solution were easily found on [w3schools.com].
What challanged me mostly this week was learning the add, commit, and push commands to Github. It took some brainpower to figure out how to push to the pands problem sheet.
This week I also completed practice on tutorials in [w3schools.com] to become more familiar with basics. I pushed these to mywork on Git hub.

# Week 2 - Bank.py
 I completed some research in w3 schools to cement the basics. I did find it difficult to relsolve differnce between how w3 school wrote the code and what we studying in the lectures/labs
I also used youtube videos as a resource - watched videos showing basics and ones similar to the questions in the problem sheets
 I use google also to help me with the accounts problem and read through some similar - Stack Overflow, digital ocean, etc - found it difficult to match how they wrote codes with our learning - very advanced.
 I made two attempted to complete the accounts extra to no joy - cannot figure how to repalce multiple digits which can vary. Maybe as the weeks go by I might get more clues how to do this.

# Week 04 -
I struggled trying to imagine how to put the maths together with the ifs and elses
 I seem to have it working on a basic level - I used the labs we did on evens and odd combined with examples on  w3 schools and my own imagination - that is the most difficult part imagining what I want.
 I wrote some "pseudo code" down and then coded along with labs and w3 schools to reflect my thoughts
 I then relaeased it has to be a continuous list of numbers until 1 - try again
 after some research online I learned about the collatx preset function and wtore up collatz 2 and tried to fix my first attempt
Two collatz programs written and both work. collatz is more explanatory. collatz 2 is one I looked at on the internet - Stack Overflow

# Week 05 
I really struggled this week. 
As per last week I thought there would be some sort of mathematical solution to this but I learned from last week. Like the collatz issue I decided to explore if there inbuilt commands in python
some googling and exploration of w3 revealed the import datetime function. Now I feel this might be doable.
I can get my programme to come up with the day. I can get it to print all the days and their associated weekday or weekend but I cant get it it to just print todays day and whether its a week day or weekend
Success - I made a number of attempts with different methods before coming to my conclusion - main difficult - reflecting that the day is only part of the list. The change came when I used for and in.
I have left in my other attempts and turned it into comments for you to see
