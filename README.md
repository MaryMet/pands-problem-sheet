# pands-problem-sheet
# I completed some research in w3 schools to cement the basics. I did find it difficult to relsolve differnce between how w3 school wrote the code and what we studying in the lectures/labs
# I also used youtube videos as a resource - watched videos showing basics and ones similar to the questions in the problem sheets
# I use google also to help me with the accounts problem and read through some similar - Stack Overflow, digital ocean, etc - found it difficult to match how they wrote codes with our learning - very advanced.
