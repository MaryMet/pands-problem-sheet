# Weeks 1 -3
 I completed some research in w3 schools to cement the basics. I did find it difficult to relsolve differnce between how w3 school wrote the code and what we studying in the lectures/labs
I also used youtube videos as a resource - watched videos showing basics and ones similar to the questions in the problem sheets
 I use google also to help me with the accounts problem and read through some similar - Stack Overflow, digital ocean, etc - found it difficult to match how they wrote codes with our learning - very advanced.
 I made two attemptd to complete the accounts extra to no joy - cannot figure how to repalce multiple digits which can vary. Maybe as the weeks go by I might get more clues how to do this.

# Week 04 -
I struggled trying to imagine how to put the maths together with the ifs and elses
 I seem to have it working on a basic level - I used the labs we did on evens and odd combined with examples on  w3 schools and my own imagination - that is the most difficult part imagining what I want.
 I wrote some "pseudo code" down and then coded along with labs and w3 schools to reflect my thoughts
 I then relaeased it has to be a continuous list of numbers until 1 - try again
 after some research online I learned about the collatx preset function and wtore up collatz 2 and tried to fix my first attempt
Two collatz programs written and both work. collatz is more explanatory. collatz 2 is one I looked at on the internet - Stack Overflow

# Week 05 
I really struggled this week. 
As per last week I thought there would be some sort of mathematical solution to this but I learned from last week. Like the collatz issue I decided to explore if there inbuilt commands in python
some googling and exploration of w3 revealed the import datetime function. Now I feel this might be doable.
I can get my programme to come up with the day. I can get it to print all the days and their associated weekday or weekend but I cant get it it to just print todays day and whether its a week day or weekend
Success - I made a number of attempts with different methods before coming to my conclusion - main difficult - reflecting that the day is only part of the list. The change came when I used for and in.
I have left in my other attempts and turned it into comments for you to see
