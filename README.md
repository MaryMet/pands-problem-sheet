# pands-problem-sheet
# I completed some research in w3 schools to cement the basics. I did find it difficult to relsolve differnce between how w3 school wrote the code and what we studying in the lectures/labs
# I also used youtube videos as a resource - watched videos showing basics and ones similar to the questions in the problem sheets
# I use google also to help me with the accounts problem and read through some similar - Stack Overflow, digital ocean, etc - found it difficult to match how they wrote codes with our learning - very advanced.
# I made two attemptd to complete the accounts extra to no joy - cannot figure how to repalce multiple digits which can vary. Maybe as the weeks go by I might get more clues how to do this.
# Week 04 - i struggled trying to imagine how to put the maths together with the ifs and elses
# Week 04 - I seem to have it working on a basic level - I used the labs we did on evens and odd combined with examples on  w3 schools and my own imagination - that is the most difficult part imagining what I want.
# Week 04 - I wrote some "pseudo code" down and then coded along with labs and w3 schools to reflect my thoughts
# Week 04 - I then relaeased it has to be a continuous list of numbers until 1 - try again
